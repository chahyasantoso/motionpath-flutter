# Phase status

Updated 2026-07-31 against `main` after the green CI gates.

| Phase | Status | Evidence | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 Baseline and guardrails | Complete | PR #66 merged; all CI jobs passed. | Closed |
| 1 Lifecycle ownership | Complete | PR #68 merged; all CI jobs passed. | Closed |
| 2 Immutable patch contract | Complete | PR #69 and PR #71 merged; interest-scoped composition, key taxonomy, normalizer, immutability tests, plugin coverage, and contract docs are complete. | Closed |
| 3 Shared Flutter renderer | Complete | PRs #73 through #80 merged; shared payload consumption, stable child rendering, interest-scoped consumers, bounded filters, z/perspective/3D transforms, image cache lifecycle, performance coverage, Spiral migration, explicit renderer key policy, and green CI are complete. | Closed |
| 4 Dynamic children and spawn lifecycle | Active | PRs #81 through #83 merged: deterministic offset ordering, top-most-first helper, redundant Spiral rebuild removed, and restart/shared-ticker lifecycle coverage. This slice locks the host Stack paint order and stable child identity. | Open. Reflow, drain, ordering, hit testing, and lifecycle cleanup still need full exit evidence |
| 5 Scroll capabilities | Partial | Scrub, viewport sampling, toggle actions, and top pinning exist. | Arbitrary pinning remains open; snap deferred |
| 6 Cross-repository parity | Partial | Initial JS fixtures plus plugin contract coverage pass. | Broader lifecycle, trigger, path, FK, trajectory, and diagnostics fixtures remain |
| 7 Carousel | Not started | No Carousel implementation. | Blocked until Phase 4 is complete |
| 8 Helix and depth | Not started | No Helix/depth renderer. | Blocked until shared renderer is complete |
| 9 Release hardening | Partial | Docs, metadata, CI, and benchmark harness exist. | Publish/security/API-doc evidence remains |
